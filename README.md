BlackDiamond
============

BlackDiamond is a font for hexadecimal numbers. It contains symbols for
`[0-9a-fA-F.:-]`.  For example, the following image shows BlackDiamond used to
write a date and time in hex-time notation. See
[a flash animation](http://web.archive.org/web/20110315191612/http://www.ruinsofmorning.net/flash/hexclock.php)
for a demonstration of hex time. The date is a generalization of hex time into a
hex date system.
